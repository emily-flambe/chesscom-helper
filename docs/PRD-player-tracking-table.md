# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Player Tracking Table Enhancement

### Document Information
- **Feature Name**: Player Tracking Table with Actions
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Created**: January 2025
- **Author**: Product Team
- **Status**: Approved for Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Transform the existing player tracking card layout into a sophisticated table view with integrated action buttons. This enhancement will provide users with a more efficient way to manage and interact with their tracked Chess.com players, enabling quick actions like enabling notifications, viewing detailed statistics, and removing players from their tracking list.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State
- Players are displayed in a card-based grid layout
- Limited information shown (username and basic status)
- No direct actions available on each player
- Users must navigate away to perform any actions
- Mobile experience is constrained by card layout

### User Pain Points
1. **Limited Information Density**: Card layout shows minimal information per player
2. **No Quick Actions**: Users cannot perform common tasks without navigation
3. **Poor Scalability**: Managing 20+ players becomes unwieldy with cards
4. **Missing Context**: No visibility into player activity patterns or statistics

## 3. Solution Overview

Replace the card-based layout with a responsive, feature-rich table that includes:
- Comprehensive player information at a glance
- Inline action buttons for common tasks
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Sorting and filtering capabilities
- Bulk action support
