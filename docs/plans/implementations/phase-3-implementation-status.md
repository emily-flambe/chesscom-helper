## 🎨 Design Standards

### Email Templates
- Mobile-responsive design (320px to 600px+)
- Chess.com Helper branding with green color scheme
- Email client compatibility (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Yahoo)
- Dark mode support with CSS media queries
- Accessibility compliance with semantic HTML

### Queue Processing
- Priority-based processing (high, medium, low)
- Batch processing for efficiency (10 emails per batch)
- Exponential backoff retry (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed emails
- Rate limiting to respect Resend API limits

### Auditing and Analytics
- Complete audit trail for all email events
- Performance metrics (processing time, queue wait time)
- Delivery success rates and analytics
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Historical data retention for reporting

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] **99.5% email delivery rate** achieved
- [ ] **95% retry success rate** for failed emails
- [ ] **<2 second processing time** per email
- [ ] **100% audit coverage** of notification events
- [ ] **Email client compatibility** across major providers
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** on all screen sizes
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** met under load

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Unit tests** with >90% code coverage
- [ ] **Integration tests** for complete email delivery flow
- [ ] **Performance tests** for queue processing under load
- [ ] **Email client tests** across major providers
- [ ] **Security tests** for webhook validation
- [ ] **Accessibility tests** for template compliance

## 🚀 Deployment Plan
