# Cloudflare Workers Edge Computing Constraints

## Overview

Cloudflare Workers operate within specific resource constraints designed to ensure fair allocation across the global edge network while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Memory Constraints

### Hard Limits
- **Maximum Memory**: 128 MB per Worker instance
- **Enforcement**: Hard limit across all plans (Free and Paid)
- **Failure Behavior**: Runtime may cancel requests if memory limit exceeded
- **Monitoring**: View memory violations in Dashboard > Workers & Pages > Metrics > Errors > Exceeded Memory

### Memory Optimization Strategies
- Use `TransformStream` API for streaming responses to avoid loading entire responses into memory
- Implement memory profiling with DevTools locally to identify leaks
- Design stateless operations where possible
- Avoid storing large datasets in memory

## CPU Time Constraints

### Time Limits
- **Default Maximum**: 30 seconds CPU time per request
- **Extended Limit**: Up to 5 minutes (300,000 ms) for CPU-bound tasks
- **Typical Usage**: Most requests consume 1-2 ms of CPU time
- **Configuration**: Set limits via Wrangler file or Cloudflare Dashboard

### CPU Time Calculation
- **Counted**: Active processing time only
- **Not Counted**: Time waiting for network requests, I/O operations, or subrequests
- **Reset Behavior**: Each new request resets available CPU time

### Historical Limits
- **Legacy Bundled Plans**: Automatic 50ms CPU limit applied post-migration
- **Billing Protection**: Configure limits to prevent runaway costs or denial-of-wallet attacks

## Execution Constraints

### Startup Time
- **Parsing Limit**: Worker must parse and execute global scope within 400ms
- **Global Scope**: Top-level code outside handlers must complete within limit
- **Impact**: Affects cold start performance

### Runtime Updates
- **Grace Period**: 30 seconds for in-flight requests during runtime updates
- **Termination**: Requests exceeding grace period are terminated
- **Planning**: Design for graceful handling of runtime transitions

## Network and Subrequest Limits

### Subrequest Quotas
- **Free Plan**: 50 subrequests per request
- **Paid Plan**: 1,000 subrequests per request
- **Use Cases**: API calls, database queries, external service integrations

### Request/Response Size
- **Considerations**: Large payloads impact memory constraints
- **Streaming**: Use streaming for large responses to avoid memory limits

## Execution Context Limitations

### Environment Restrictions
- **No Filesystem Access**: Traditional file I/O operations unavailable
- **Limited Globals**: Restricted global object access
- **Stateless Design**: No persistent memory between requests
- **Cold Start Impact**: New instances start with clean slate

### State Management Constraints
- **Between Requests**: No persistent memory available
- **Session State**: Must use external storage (KV, D1, Durable Objects)
- **Caching**: Implement application-level caching strategies

## Geographic Distribution Challenges

### Data Locality
- **Smart Placement**: Dynamically positions Workers near backend services
- **Latency Optimization**: Reduces total request latency including database calls
- **Consistency**: Potential issues with distributed state management

### Edge Network Characteristics
- **Global Distribution**: Workers run on 200+ edge locations
- **Instance Isolation**: No shared memory between geographic instances
- **Data Synchronization**: Requires external coordination mechanisms

## Durable Objects Specific Constraints

### CPU Limits
- **Per Invocation**: Same 30-second limits as regular Workers
- **Reset Behavior**: Each HTTP request or WebSocket message resets CPU timer
- **Eviction Risk**: >30 seconds compute between requests increases eviction chance

### Memory Sharing
- **Isolation**: Each Durable Object instance has separate 128MB limit
- **Persistence**: Objects can maintain state between requests
- **Coordination**: Limited by network latency between objects

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Cold Start Minimization
- **Bundle Size**: Keep Worker code minimal
- **Dependencies**: Avoid heavy libraries in global scope
- **Initialization**: Defer expensive operations until needed

### Memory Management
- **Streaming**: Use streams for large data processing
- **Garbage Collection**: Design for efficient memory cleanup
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse objects where possible within request scope

### CPU Optimization
- **Async Operations**: Maximize use of I/O wait time
- **Batching**: Combine operations to reduce overhead
- **Caching**: Cache expensive computations in external storage

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Available Metrics
- **CPU Time Usage**: Track per-request CPU consumption
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory allocation patterns
- **Error Rates**: Track limit violations and failures
- **Latency**: Measure edge-to-backend performance

### Debugging Tools
- **Local Development**: Use Wrangler for local testing
- **DevTools Integration**: Memory profiling and performance analysis
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Architectural Implications

### Design Principles
- **Stateless Operations**: Design for horizontal scaling
- **Fail-Fast**: Handle constraint violations gracefully
- **External State**: Use appropriate storage services for persistence
- **Resource Budgeting**: Plan CPU and memory usage patterns

### Service Selection
- **Workers**: Best for lightweight, stateless operations
- **Durable Objects**: For stateful, coordinated operations
- **External Services**: For heavy processing or large data storage

## Best Practices

### Development
- **Constraint Testing**: Test against resource limits during development
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle limit violations appropriately
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive observability
- **Documentation**: Document resource usage patterns

### Production
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor and plan for resource usage
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for constraint failures
- **Performance Budgets**: Set and monitor performance thresholds
- **Scaling Strategy**: Design for constraint-aware scaling
